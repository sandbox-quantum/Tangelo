"""This module implements functions to create the direct interaction set (DIS)
of generators for the qubit coupled cluster (QCC) ansatz and is based on Ref. 1.
The DIS consists of generator groups that are characterized by the magnitude of
the gradient of the QCC energy functional with respect to a variational parameter
tau, |dEQCC/dtau|. Nonzero values of |dEQCC/dtau| imply that an individual
generator will contribute to variational energy lowering. The number of DIS groups
cannot exceed the number of Hamiltonian terms, N, and each DIS group contains
2^nq - 1 generators, where nq is the number of qubits, all with identical values
of |dEQCC/dtau|. By constructing the DIS, it is possible to identify O(N * (2^nq - 1))
generators that are strong energy-lowering candidates for the QCC ansatz at a
cost of O(N) gradient evaluations. In contrast, a brute-force strategy requires
O(4^nq) gradient evaluations.
