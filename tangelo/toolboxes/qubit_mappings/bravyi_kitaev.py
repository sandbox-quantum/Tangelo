"""Tools for performing Bravyi-Kitaev Transformation, as prescribed via the
Fenwick Tree mapping. This implementation accommodates mapping of qubit
registers where the number of qubits is not a power of two.

NB: this is a minimal implementation, just wrapping around current openfermion
code (v 1.0.1). This wrapper enables future refactoring to utilize our own
implementation, as needed.

    Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. Important note: there are several
    implementations of "Bravyi Kitaev" transformation, in both the literature,
    and historical versions of openfermion. This function executes the
    transformaton defined in arXiv:quant-ph/0003137. Different versions are not
    necessarily the same, and result in undesirable performance. This method is
    a simple wrapper around openfermion's bravyi_kitaev, but we are forcing the
    user to pass n_qubits to avoid unexpected behaviour.

            transformed.
