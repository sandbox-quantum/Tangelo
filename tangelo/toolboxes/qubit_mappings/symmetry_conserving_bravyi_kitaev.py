    """Returns the QubitOperator for the FermionOperator supplied, with two
    qubits removed using conservation of (parity) of electron spin and number,
    as described in arXiv:1701.08213.  This function has been modified from its
    analogous implementation in openfermion in order to circumvent failures when
    passing a fermion_operator which does not explicitly reference the highest
    index qubit in the register.

    Args:
        fermion_operator (FermionOperator): fermionic operator to transform to
            QubitOperator.
        n_spinorbitals (int): The number of active spin-orbitals being
            considered for the system.
        n_electrons (int): The number of active fermions being considered for
            the system (note, this is less than the number of electrons in a
            molecule if some orbitals have been frozen).
        up_then_down (bool): specify if the spin-orbital basis is already
            ordered putting all spin up before all spin down states.

    Returns:
        QubitOperator: The qubit operator corresponding to the supplied
            fermionic operator, with two qubits removed using spin symmetries.

    WARNING:
        Reorders orbitals from the default even-odd ordering to all spin-up
        orbitals, then all spin-down orbitals.

    Raises:
        ValueError if fermion_hamiltonian isn"t of the type FermionOperator, or
        active_orbitals isn"t an integer, or active_fermions isn"t an integer.

    Notes: This function reorders the spin orbitals as all spin-up, then all
        spin-down. It uses the OpenFermion bravyi_kitaev_tree mapping, rather
        than the bravyi-kitaev mapping. Caution advised when using with a
        Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; this technique correctly reduces the
        Hamiltonian only for the lowest energy even and odd fermion number
        states, not states with an arbitrary number of fermions.
