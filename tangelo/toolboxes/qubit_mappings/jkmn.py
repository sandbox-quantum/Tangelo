    The algorithm is described in arXiv:1910.10746v2

    Although all assignments of leaves to Majorana modes are valid (with one arbitrary leaf being dropped),
    this function assigns leaves to majorana modes via the following process
    1) The furthest right leaf is the mode dropped.
    2) One can obtain the vaccuum state by applying Hadamard transforms to certain qubits.
       This essentially reorders the assignment of leafs to Majorana modes as HXH=Z, HZH=X, HYH=-Y, HH=I
    3) The order is finalized by assigning \gamma_{2*i} with 'X' on qubit i and \gamma_{2*i+1}
       has 'Y' on qubit i. If \gamma_{2*i} and \gamma_{2*i+1} were swapped, a negative sign on one of the
       \gamma_{2*i} or \gamma_{2*i+1} Majorana modes would be required to obtain a valid vaccuum state.

    This process ensures that all number operators a_i^{\dagger}a_i = 1/2*(1 + 1j*\gamma_{2*i}\gamma_{2*j+1})
    result in qubit operators with only Z operators including Z on qubit i.
