"""Jordan-Wigner transform on fermionic operators."""

def jordan_wigner(operator):
    r"""Apply the Jordan-Wigner transform to a FermionOperator,
    InteractionOperator, or DiagonalCoulombHamiltonian to convert to a
    QubitOperator.

    Operators are mapped as follows:
    a_j^\dagger -> Z_0 .. Z_{j-1} (X_j - iY_j) / 2
    a_j -> Z_0 .. Z_{j-1} (X_j + iY_j) / 2

    Returns:
        QubitOperator: An instance of the QubitOperator class.

    Warning:
        The runtime of this method is exponential in the maximum locality of the
        original FermionOperator.

    Raises:
        TypeError: Operator must be a FermionOperator,
        DiagonalCoulombHamiltonian, or InteractionOperator.
