"""Module that defines helper functions to taper qubits in a molecular problem
with Z2 tapering.

For all chemical Hamiltonians, there are at least two symmetries (electron
number and spin conservation) that reduce the qubits count by two. Furthermore,
molecular symmetries can lead to a reduction of the number of qubits required to
encode a problem. Those symmetries can be interpreted as degenerated
eigenvalues. In the real space, symmetry operations lead to the same total
energy.

    applying the eigenvalues to account for tapered elements, the operator is
