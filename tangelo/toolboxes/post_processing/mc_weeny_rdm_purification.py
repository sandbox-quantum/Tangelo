def mcweeny_purify_2rdm(rdm2_spin, conv=1.0e-07):
    """Perform 2-RDM purification based on McWeeny"s algorithm. The value
    selected for the convergence criteria should be consistent with the accuracy
    of the 2-RDM provided as input (in particular it should be correlated to the
    number of shots used to compute the RDM values, if a QPU or a shot-based
    quantum circuit simulator was used).

    This algorithm only works on a RDM associated with a 2-electron system.

    Args:
        rdm2_spin (numpy array): The 2-RDM to be purified (in chemistry
            notation).
        conv (float), optional: The convergence criteria for McWeeny"s
            purification.

    Returns:
        numpy.array: One-particle RDM in spatial orbital basis.
        numpy.array: Two-particle RDM in spatial orbital basis (in chemistry
            notation).
