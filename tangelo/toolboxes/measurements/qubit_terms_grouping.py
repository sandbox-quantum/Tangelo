def group_qwc(qb_ham, seed=None, n_repeat=1):
    """Wrapper around Openfermion functionality that takes as input a
    QubitOperator and yields a collection of measurement bases defining a
    partition of groups of sub-operators with terms that are diagonal in the
    same tensor product basis. Each sub-operator can be measured using the same
    qubit post-rotations in expectation estimation. This uses the idea of
    qubitwise commutativity (qwc), and the minimum clique cover algorithm.

    The resulting dictionary maps the measurement basis (key) to the list of
    qubit operators whose expectation value can be computed using the
    corresponding circuit. The size of this dictionary determines how many
    quantum circuits need to be executed in order to provide the expectation
    value of the input qubit operator.

    The minimum clique cover algorithm can be initialized with a random seed
    and can be repeated several times with different seeds in order to return
    the run that produces the lowest number of groups.

    Args:
        qb_ham (QubitOperator): the operator that will be split into
            sub-operators (tensor product basis sets).
        seed (int): default None. Random seed used to initialize the
            numpy.RandomState pseudo-RNG.
        n_repeat (int): Repeat with a different random seed, keep the outcome
            resulting in the lowest number of groups.

    Returns:
        dict: a dictionary where each key defines a tensor product basis, and
            each corresponding value is a QubitOperator with terms that are all
            diagonal in that basis.
