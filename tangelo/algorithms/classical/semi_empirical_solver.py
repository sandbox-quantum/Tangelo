"""Class performing electronic structure calculation employing the
semi-empirical methods. At first, semi-empirical methods are ways of computing
the total energy of a molecule in a very fast way to optimize its geometry.
Those methods are not ab initio as they employ empirical parameters, as stated
in the name "semi-empirical". They are in fact related to simplified
Hartree-Fock versions with empirical corrections. Differences between them come
from the process chosen to compute the empirical parameters. For example, MINDO3
inventors used atomization energies to fit their mathematical models.

They have been introduced in this package for the purpose of computing an
environment energy and inducing constraints on atomic positions. As stand-alone
solvers, they are however a poor choice, as they do not provide an accurate
approximation of energies.

Here are the semi-empirical method(s) implemented:
    - MINDO3
