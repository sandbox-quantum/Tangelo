"""Our own n-layered Integrated molecular Orbital and Molecular mechanics
(ONIOM) solver. User specifies either the number (if beginning from start of
list), or the indices, of atoms which are to be identified as the model
system(s), from the larger molecular system.

Main model class for running oniom-calculations. This is analogous to the
scf.RHF, etc. methods, requiring however a bit more information. User supplies
an atomic-geometry, and specifies the system, as well as necessary models,
of increasing sophistication.
